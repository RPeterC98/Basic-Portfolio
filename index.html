            <img id="id" src="assets/css/images/cat.jpg"> Hello everyone! I'm Peter Christensen and this is my portfolio, I'm 20 years old, living in Oro Valley but I
            originally hail from Upstate New York (Schylurville to be exact). I currently work at Chilis, and like to do
            absolutely nothing extraordinary as far as 20 year olds are concerned! For example, my hobbies include playing
            video games, staying up all night, and playing sports with my buddies. I listen to just about any kind of music
            as long as it isnt country, or modern rap (keep those oldies coming tho). My favorite color is red, and my favorite
            food is, at this moment, Mexican food. My sports teams, for those who care, are all the good New York teams,
            if you need a reminder, let me tell you!</p>
        <ol>
            <br>
            <li>• New York Giants</li>
            <li>• New York Yankees</li>
            <li>• New York Rangers</li>
            <li>• New York Knicks</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I'm not a huge fan of TV, but there are still some things I watch like Supernatural and sports, other than that I check out
            Netflix and watch Anime. Favorite Anime? Dragon Ball Z. Other than that, i'm pretty bland! (Thats my coworker
            Daniel in the picture btw)
